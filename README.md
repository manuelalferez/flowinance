## Getting Started

Flowinance is running its database on Supabase. Supabase allows you to run a local instance, so you donâ€™t have to worry about breaking the production database. First, we are going to configure Supabase locally, following the [documentation](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) that Supabase provides. In this example, we will do it using a Mac, but check their documentation for adapting it to your operating system.

1. Install the Supabase CLI: 
    ```bash
    brew install supabase/tap/supabase
    ```
2. The Supabase CLI uses Docker containers to manage the local development stack. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/). 
3. Run Docker. 
4. Run Supabase locally:
    ```bash
    supabase start
    ```
5. Once all of the Supabase services are running, you'll see output containing your local Supabase credentials. Copy them into your `.env.local` file: 
    ```bash
    Started supabase local development setup.

            API URL: http://localhost:54321
            DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
        Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
        Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
            anon key: eyJh......
    service_role key: eyJh......
    ```
6. You can check Supabase studio at http://localhost:54323
    <p align="center">

    </p>

    When you are finished working on your Supabase project, you can stop the stack:

    ```bash
    supabase stop
    ```

7. Install dependencies: 
   ```bash
   npm i
   ```
8. Flowinance uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) for handling the types and migrations of the database. If this is the first time you are setting up the project, generate the tables for your Supabase local instance: 
    ```bash
    npx prisma migrate dev --name init
    ````

9. That's it! ðŸŽ‰ Run Flowinance's development server and open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
